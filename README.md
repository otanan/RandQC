## General info
This module makes use of pseudo-random number generators and Qutip to make generating random quantum circuits, random quantum states, and track quantities of interest for these objects much easier. This module also handles IO for these objects so saving and storing them can be automated, facilitating data gathering and data access for analysis.

## Setup
In the base folder with where setup.py is located and in a virtual environment with Python 3.5+ just run
`python3 -m pip install .`

You can read the documentation for RandQC in docs/build/index.html.
